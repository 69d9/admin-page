PathFind - Admin Page Finder

PathFind is a tool designed to assist security researchers, penetration testers, and ethical hackers in locating administrative pages for various Content Management Systems (CMS). It helps identify common admin page paths for popular CMS platforms like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and Magento.

The tool automatically detects the CMS used by a website and checks predefined paths for potential admin URLs. It then saves any discovered admin URLs to a file for further analysis. PathFind provides detailed output, including HTTP response status codes and redirection information, helping users assess the security of websites effectively.
